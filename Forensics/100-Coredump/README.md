F100 - Coredump
===============

We've found a `core` file in a repository on GitHub. The developer should have
added core dumps to his `.gitignore`. See if you can do anything with it.


Testing
-------

Core dumps must be enabled first with `ulimit -c unlimited`.

Run `make` to create a `core` file to make available to contestants. The answer
must be in the first 40 lines of strings output for this to be doable quickly.
