W200 - The Document Root
==============

A site was hacked. You were hired to find out how the attackers manage to exfiltrate sensitive information such as the database configuration file. The only information you have is the document root of the hacked site and you must find out the name of the vulnerability that was exploited (the vanity name, not the CVE).


Installing
